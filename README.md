# Shell-scripts
A collection of shell scripts I frequent to improve productivity.
# Getting started
- `CD` into the path of the script
- Make the script an `Excecutable` then run `chmod +x build.sh`
- Run `./build.sh` to execute.
- `Xamarin` & `.NET` workload uninstall script included
# Maui Scripts
- Place `clean.sh` in the same directory that houses your .csproj
- Open terminal and `cd` into that directory
- Enter `sh clean.sh` to begin, maybe need sudo.
- Place `maui.sh` into the root directory of your project
- `cd` into that directory and run `sh maui.sh`
- It will find and remove `.DS_Store` & `bin` , `obj` folders
